# Automating Payments Snap

This is a snap with multiple features. In this snap we have multiple componenets: 
* Making a Scheduled Payment at a particular data and time
* Have Recurring Payments every month 
* Show the graphs to analyse the transaction details made on any transaction

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed: 

* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) 
* [MetaMask Flask](https://metamask.io/flask/)\* 
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* A text editor or IDE like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* Optionally, a [GitHub account](https://github.com/) and a git client like [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

\* *Please note: MetaMask Flask is experimental preview software. Please do not use your existing secret recovery phrase or keys with Flask. It is recommended that you create a new SRP for testing with Flask.*
